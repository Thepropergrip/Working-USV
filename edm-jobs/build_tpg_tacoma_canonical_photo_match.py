# Canonical Tacoma photo-match pass.
# IMPORTANT: This is intentionally ONE source-mesh-derived body pass from FBX_Plane.001.
# It replaces the old V13->V17 cumulative deformation chain. All body corrections use
# bounded/absolute target envelopes so they do not compound across releases.
# DCS wheel hierarchy, arg 8 wheel roll, arg 9 steering, gameplay tuning, collision,
# LOD/destroyed structure, materials, registration and official ED exporter are untouched.
#
# Visual-QA correction, 2026-09-06:
# Preserve the original FBX greenhouse/window topology and work only on narrow silhouette
# bands. The V18 clay set exported cleanly, but side/front-3Q still showed two hero-body
# problems: the upper A-pillar/windshield transition remained too swept and continuous with
# the roof, and the hood/fender top read as one inflated dome instead of the flatter Tacoma
# hood plateau with a defined outer shoulder. V19 corrects those cues with bounded source-
# mesh edits only; no generated geometry and no wheel/export/gameplay changes.
#
# Exporter safety: this stage stays source-mesh-only. The exporter-proven generated topper
# is retained until any replacement topper has independently passed the ED EDM exporter.
